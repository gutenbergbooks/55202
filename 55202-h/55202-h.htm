<h2>DRIMNAGH CASTLE, COUNTY OF DUBLIN.</h2>

<p>Among the many objects of historical or picturesque interest
in the immediate vicinity of our metropolis, there are
few, perhaps, better worthy of a visit than the subject of our
prefixed illustration&mdash;the old Castle of Drimnagh, which is
situated between the villages of Crumlin and Clondalkin, and
distant about three miles from the city. We have here presented
to us an ancient castellated residence, of irregular but
highly picturesque outline, still surrounded and protected by
its ancient moat, and, though in good condition and inhabited,
still retaining to such an extent its original character as
a place of strength, that as we look upon it, we might almost
imagine ourselves living in the ages of its military greatness,
and belonging to a state of society very different from that
secure and peaceful one in which we happily have our existence.
In addition to these circumstances, the Castle of
Drimnagh is highly interesting, from the beauty and picturesqueness
of its situation, which is not only strikingly romantic
in itself, but commands a variety of views of the most
pleasing character; as the scenery of the City and Bay towards
the east; that of the Park, Castleknock, and Clondalkin, towards
the north; and, in congenial harmony with its ivied walls, the
dark mountains of the county of Dublin towards the south&mdash;the
wild fastnesses of the Irish clans whose predatory aggressions
it was originally built to repress.</p>

<p>The date of the erection of this castle is not exactly known,
but there is every reason to presume that it was originally
founded as early as the reign of John, by Hugh de Bernivale,
who it is probable came with that Prince into Ireland, and
at all events received in 1215 a grant from him of the lands
of Drimnagh and Terenure, which continued in the possession
of his descendants for four centuries afterwards. It is from
this Hugh de Bernivale, who, as it is said, derived his descent
from the ancient Dukes of Brittany, that the several noble
families of Barnwall, in Ireland, descend. He died in 1221,
leaving a son and heir, Hugo, who died without issue the 8th
of October 1237; and another son, Reginald, who becoming
heir to his brother, had his inheritance of four carracutes of
land with their appurtenances in Drimnagh and Terenure
confirmed to him by patent, by king Henry III. These possessions
were ultimately, and after much litigation, alienated
from the family in the reign of James I, when they passed
into the hands of Sir Adam Loftus, ancestor of the noble family
of Ely; but Drimnagh Castle is at present the property
of the Marquis of Lansdowne.</p>

<p>The Castle of Drimnagh has been repaired or re-edified
at various times, so that it is not an easy matter to determine
at present what portions of it are of great antiquity, and
what are altogether of more recent date; but upon the whole
it will convey a very good idea of the fortified residence of a
noble family in Ireland previous to the close of the seventeenth
century. During the troubles consequent upon the
great rebellion of 1641, it was considered a fortress of such
consequence that the Duke of Ormond had, in 1649, some
thoughts of strengthening its fortifications and making it his
residence, but was dissuaded from doing so by General Purcile
and other officers of his army.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE FOSTER BROTHER.</h2>

<p class="center">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a trait of human nature involved in more
mystery, or generally less understood, than the singular
strength of affection which binds the humble peasant of Irish
life to his foster-brother, and more especially if the latter be
a person of rank or consideration. This anomalous attachment,
though it may to a certain extent be mutual, is nevertheless
very seldom known to be equal in strength between
the parties. Experience has sufficiently proved to us, that
whilst instances of equality in feeling have been known to
characterize it, the predominant power of its spirit has always
been found to exist in the person of the humbler party. How
to account for this would certainly require a more philosophical
acquaintance with human nature than has fallen to our
lot; we must therefore be content to know that the fact is precisely
as we have stated it. Irish history and tradition furnish
us with sufficient materials on which to ground clear
and distinct proofs that the attachment of habit and contiguity
in these instances far transcends that of natural affection
itself. It is very seldom that one brother will lay down his
life for another, and yet instances of such high and heroic sacrifices
have occurred in the case of the foster-brother, whose
affection has thus not unfrequently triumphed over death itself.
It is certainly impossible to impute this wild but indomitable
attachment to the force of domestic feeling, because, whilst
we maintain that the domestic affections in Ireland are certainly
stronger than those of any other country in the world,
still instances of this inexplicable devotion have occurred in the
persons of those in whom the domestic ties were known to be
very feeble. It is true, there are many moral anomalies in the
human heart with which we are as yet but imperfectly acquainted;
and as they arise from some wayward and irregular combination
of its impulses, that operates independently of any
known principles of action, it is not likely that we shall ever
thoroughly understand them. There is another peculiarity in
Irish feeling, which, as it is analogous to this, we cannot neglect
to mention it. We allude to the <em>Parisheen</em>, a term which
we must explain at further length to our readers. When the
Dublin Foundling Hospital was in existence, the poor infants
whom an unhappy destiny consigned to that gloomy and withering
institution were transmitted to different parts of the
country, to be nursed by the wives of the lower classes of the
peasantry&mdash;such as day-labourers, cottiers, and small farmers,
who cultivated from three to six or eight acres of land. These
children were generally, indeed almost always, called Parisheens&mdash;a
word which could be properly applied only to such as,
having no known parents, were supported by the parish in which
they happened to be born. It was transferred to the Foundlings,
however; although, with the exception of the metropolis, which
certainly paid a parish tax for their maintenance, they were
principally supported by a very moral act of Parliament,
which, by the wise provision of a large grant, held out a very
liberal bounty to profligacy. At all events, the opprobrious
epithet of Parisheen was that usually fixed upon them.</p>

<p>Now, of all classes of our fellow-creatures, one might almost
naturally suppose that those deserted and forsaken beings
would be apt, consigned as they uniformly were to the care of
mercenary strangers, to experience neglect, ill-treatment, or
even cruelty itself; and yet, honour be to the generous hearts
and affectionate feelings of our humble people, it has been
proved, by the incontestible authority of a Commission expressly
appointed to examine and report on the working of
the very hospital in question, that the care, affection, and tenderness
with which these ill-fated creatures were treated by
the nurses to whom they were given out, was equal, if not superior,
to that which was bestowed upon their own children.
Even when removed from these nurses to situations of incomparably
more comfort&mdash;situations in which they were lodged,
fed, and clothed, in a far superior manner&mdash;they have been
known, in innumerable instances, to elope from their masters
and mistresses, and return to their old abodes, preferring the
indulgence of their affection, with poverty and distress, to any
thing else that life could offer.</p>

<p>All this, however, was very natural and reasonable, for we
know that even the domestic animal will love the hand that
feeds him. But that which we have alluded to as constituting
the strong analogy between it and the attachment of the foster-brother,
is the well-known fact, that the affection of the
children to the nurses, though strong and remarkable, was as
nothing when compared with that which the nurses felt for
them. This was proved by a force of testimony which no
scepticism could encounter. The parting scenes between them
were affecting, and in many instances agonizing, to the last
degree. Nay, nurses have frequently come up to Dublin, and
with tears in their eyes, and in accents of the most unfeigned
sorrow, begged that the orphans might be allowed to stay with
them, undertaking, rather than part with them, that they
would support them at their own expense. It would be
very difficult to produce a more honourable testimony
to the moral honesty, generosity, and exquisite kindness of
heart which characterize our people, than the authentic facts
we have just mentioned. They fell naturally in our way
when treating of the subject which preceded them, and we
could not, in justice to circumstances so beautiful and striking,
much less injustice to the people themselves, pass them over in
silence.</p>

<p>We shall now relate a short story, illustrating the attachment
of a foster-brother; but as we have reason to believe
that the circumstances are true, we shall introduce fictitious
names instead of real ones.</p>

<p>The rebellion of ninety-eight was just at its height, when
the incidents we are about to mention took place. A gentleman
named Moore had a daughter remarkable for her beauty
and accomplishments. Indeed, so celebrated had she become,
that her health was always drunk as the toast of her native
county. Many suitors she had, of course, but among the
rest two were remarkable for their assiduous attentions to her,
and an intense anxiety to secure her affections. Henry Irwin
was a high loyalist, as was her own father, whose consent to
gain the affections of his daughter had been long given to his
young friend. The other, who in point of fact had already
secured her affections, was unfortunately deeply involved in,
or we should rather say an open leader on, the insurgent side.
His principles had become known to Moore, as republican, for
some time before the breaking out of the insurrection; in consequence
he was forbidden his house, and warned against holding
communication with any member of his family. He had succeeded,
however, before this, by the aid of Miss Moore herself,
who was aware of his principles, in placing as butler in her father’s
family his own foster-brother, Frank Finnegan&mdash;an arrangement
which never would have been permitted, had Moore
known of the peculiar bond of affection which subsisted between
them. Of this, however, he was ignorant; and in admitting
Finnegan into his family, he was not aware of the advantages
he afforded to the proscribed suitor of his daughter. This
interdiction, however, came too late for the purposes of prudence.
Ere it was issued, Hewson and his daughter had exchanged
vows of mutual affection; but the national outbreak
which immediately ensued, by forcing Hewson to assume his
place as an insurgent leader, appeared to have placed a barrier
between him and her, which was naturally considered to be
insurmountable. In the meantime, Moore himself, who was a
local magistrate, and also a captain of yeomanry, took an extremely
active part in quelling the insurrection, and in hunting
down and securing the rebels. Nor was Irwin less zealous in
following the footsteps of the man to whom he wished to recommend
himself as his future son-in-law. They acted together;
and so vigorous were the measures of the young loyalist,
that the other felt it necessary in some instances to check
the exuberance of his loyalty. This, however, was not known
to the opposite party; for as Irwin always seemed to act under
the instructions of his friend Moore, so was it obviously enough
inferred that every harsh act and wanton stretch of authority
which he committed, was either sanctioned or suggested by
the other. The consequence was, that Moore became, if possible,
more odious than Irwin, who was looked upon as a rash,
hot-headed zealot; whilst the veteran was marked as a cool
and wily old fox, who had ten times the cunning and cruelty
of the senseless puppet he was managing. In this, it is unnecessary
to say, they were egregiously mistaken.</p>

<p>In the meantime the rebellion went forward, and many acts
of cruelty and atrocity were committed on both sides. Moore’s
house and family would have been attacked, and most probably
murder and ruin might have visited him and his, were it
not for the influence of Hewson with the rebels. Twice did
the latter succeed, and on each occasion with great difficulty,
in preventing him and his household from falling victims to the
vengeance of the insurgents. Moore was a man of great personal
courage, but apt to underrate the character and enterprize
of those who were opposed to him. Indeed, his prudence
was by no means on a par with his bravery or zeal, for he has
often been known to sally out at the head of a party in quest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
of his enemies, and leave his own mansion, and the lives of
those who were in it, exposed and defenceless.</p>

<p>On one of those excursions it was that he chanced to capture
a small body of the insurgents, headed by an intimate friend
and distant relative of Hewson’s. As the law at that unhappy
period was necessarily quick in its operations, we need
scarcely say, that, having been taken openly armed against the
King and the Constitution, they were tried and executed by
the summary sentence of a court-martial. A deep and bloody
vengeance was now sworn against him and his by the rebels,
who for some time afterwards lay in wait for the purpose
of retaliating in a spirit prompted by the atrocious character
of the times.</p>

<p>Hewson’s attachment to his daughter, however, had been
long known, and his previous interference on behalf of her father
had been successful on that account only. Now, however,
the plan of attack was laid without his cognizance, and that
with the most solemn injunctions to every one concerned in it
not to disclose their object to any human being not officially
acquainted with it, much less to Hewson, who they calculated
would once more take such steps as might defeat their sanguinary
purpose. These arrangements having been made, matters
were allowed to remain quiet for a little, until Moore
should be off his guard; for we must observe here, that he
had felt it necessary, after the execution of the captured rebels,
to keep his house strongly and resolutely defended. The
attack was therefore postponed until the apprehensions created
by his recent activity should gradually wear away, and his enemies
might with less risk undertake the work of bloodshed and
destruction. The night at length was appointed on which the
murderous attack must be made. All the dark details were
arranged with a deliberation at which, removed as we now are
from the sanguinary excitement of the times, the very soul
shudders and gets sick. A secret, however, communicated even
under the most solemn sanction to a great number, stands a
great chance of being no secret at all, especially during civil
war, where so many interests of friendship, blood, and marriage,
bind the opposing parties together in spite of the public
principles under which they act. Miss Moore’s maid had
a brother, for instance, who, together with several of his
friends and relatives, being appointed to aid in the attack, felt
anxious that she should not be present on that night, lest her
acquaintance with them might be ultimately dangerous to the
assailants. He accordingly sought an opportunity of seeing
her, and in earnest language urged her to absent herself
from her master’s house on the appointed night. The girl
was not much surprised at the ambiguity of his hints, for the
truth was, that no person, man or woman, possessing common
sense, could be ignorant of the state of the country, or of the
evil odour in which Moore and Irwin, and all those who were
active on the part of government, were held. She accordingly
told him that she would follow his advice, and spoke to him in
terms so shrewd and significant, that he deemed it useless to
preserve further secrecy. The plot was thus disclosed, and
the girl warned to leave the house, both for her own sake and
for that of those who were to wreak their vengeance upon
Moore and his family.</p>

<p>The poor girl, hoping that her master and the rest might
fly from the impending danger, communicated the circumstances
to Miss Moore, who forthwith communicated them to her
father, who, again, instead of flying, took measures to collect
about his premises, during the early part of the dreaded night,
a large and well-armed force from the next military station.
Now, it so happened that this girl, whose name was Baxter,
had a leaning towards Hewson’s foster-brother Finnegan,
who in plain language was her accepted lover. If love will
not show itself in a case of danger, it is good for nothing.
We need scarcely say that Peggy Baxter, apprehensive of
danger to her sweetheart, confided the secret to him also in
the early part of the day of the attack. Finnegan was surprised,
especially when he heard from Peggy that Hewson had
been kept in ignorance of the whole design (for so her brother
had told her), in consequence of his attachment to her young
mistress. There was now no possible way of warding off
such a calamity, unless by communicating with Hewson; and
this, as Finnegan was a sound United Irishman, he knew he
could do without any particular danger. He lost no time,
therefore, in seeing him; and we need scarcely say that his
foster-brother felt stunned and thunderstruck at the deed that
was about to be perpetrated without his knowledge. Finnegan
then left him, but ere he reached home, the darkness had
set in, and on arriving, he sought the kitchen and its comforts,
ignorant, as were indeed most of the servants, that the upper
rooms and out-houses were literally crammed with fierce and
well-armed soldiers.</p>

<p>Matters were now coming to a crisis. Hewson, aware that
there was little time to be lost, collected a small party of his
own immediate and personal friends, not one of whom, from
their known attachment to him, had been, any more than himself,
admitted to a knowledge of their attack upon Moore.
Determined, therefore, to be beforehand with the others, he
and they met at an appointed place, from whence they went
quickly, and with as much secrecy as possible, to Moore’s
house, for the purpose not only of apprising him of the fate
to which he and his were doomed, but also with an intention
of escorting him and all his family as far from his house as
might be consistent with the safety of both parties. Our
readers are of course prepared for the surprise and capture
of honest Hewson and his friends, of whose friendly intentions
they are aware. It is too true. Not expecting to find the
house defended, they were unprepared for an attack or sally;
and the upshot was, that in a few minutes two of them were
shot, and most of the rest, among whom was Hewson, taken
prisoners on the spot. Those who escaped communicated to
the other insurgents an account of the strength with which
Moore’s house was defended; and the latter, instead of making
an attempt to rescue their friends, abandoned the meditated
attack altogether, and left Hewson and his party to their fate.
A gloomy fate that was. Assertions and protestations of
their innocence were all in vain. An insurgent party were
expected to attack the house, and of course they came, headed
by Hewson himself, who, as Moore said, no doubt intended to
spare none of them but his daughter, and her, only, in order
that she might become a rebel’s wife. Irwin, too, his rival in
love and his foe in politics, was on the court-martial, and what
had he to expect? Death; and nothing but the darkness of
the night prevented his enemies from putting it into immediate
execution upon him and his companions.</p>

<p>Hewson maintained a dignified silence; and upon seeing his
friends guarded from the hall where they were now assembled
into a large barn, he desired to be placed along with them.</p>

<p>“No,” said Moore; “if you are a rebel ten times over, you
are a gentleman; you must not herd with them; and besides,
Mr Hewson, with great respect to you, we shall place you in
a much safer place. In the highest room in a house unusually
high, we shall lodge you, out of which if you escape, we will
say you are an innocent man. Frank Finnegan, show him
and those two soldiers up to the observatory; get him refreshments,
and leave him in their charge. Guard his door, men, for
you shall be held responsible for his appearance in the
morning.”</p>

<p>The men, in obedience to these orders, escorted him to the
door, outside of which was their station for the night. When
Frank and he entered the observatory, the former gently
shut the door, and, turning to his foster-brother, exclaimed in
accents of deep distress, but lowering his voice, “There is
not a moment to be lost; you must escape.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” replied Hewson, “unless I had wings
and could use them.”</p>

<p>“We must try,” returned Frank; “we can only fail&mdash;at
the most they can only take your life, and that they’ll do at
all events.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” said Hewson, “and I am prepared for it.”</p>

<p>“Hear me,” said the other; “I will come up by and bye with
refreshments, say in about half an hour; be you stripped when
I come. We are both of a size; and as these fellows don’t
know either of us very well, I wouldn’t say but you may go out
in my clothes. I’ll hear nothing,” he added, seeing Hewson
about to speak; “I am here too long, and these fellows might
begin to suspect something. Be prepared when I come.
Good bye, Mr Hewson,” he said aloud, as he opened the
door; “in troth an’ conscience I’m sorry to see you here,
but that’s the consequence of turnin’ rebel against King
George, an’ glory to him&mdash;<em>soon and sudden</em>,” he added in an
undertone. “In about half an hour I’ll bring you up some
supper, sir. Keep a sharp eye on him,” he whispered to the
two soldiers, giving them at the same time a knowing and confidential
wink; “these same rebels are like eels, an’ will slip
as aisily through your fingers&mdash;an’ the devil a better one yez
have in there;” and as he spoke, he pointed over his shoulder
with his inverted thumb to the door of the observatory.</p>

<p>Much about the time he had promised to return, a crash was
heard upon the stairs, and Finnegan’s voice in a high key exclaiming,
“The curse o’ blazes on you for stairs, an’ hell <em>presume</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
all the rebels in Europe, I pray heavens this night!
There’s my nose broke between you all!” He then stooped
down, and in a torrent of bitter imprecations&mdash;all conveyed,
however, in mock oaths&mdash;he collected and placed again upon
the tray on which they had been, all the materials for Hewson’s
supper. He then ascended, and on presenting himself at the
prisoner’s door, the blood was copiously streaming from his
nose. The soldiers&mdash;who by the way were yeomen&mdash;on seeing
him, could not avoid laughing at his rueful appearance&mdash;a circumstance
which seemed to nettle him a good deal. “Yez
may laugh!” he exclaimed, “but I’d hould a wager I’ve shed
more blood for his majesty this night than either of you ever
did in your lives!”</p>

<p>This only heightened their mirth, in the midst of which he
entered Hewson’s room; and ere the action could be deemed
possible, they had exchanged clothes.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “fly. Behind the garden Miss Moore is
waitin’ for you; she knows all. Take the bridle-road through
the broad bog, an’ get into Captain Corny’s demesne. Take
my advice too, an’ go both of you to America, if you can. But,
aisy. God forgive me for pullin’ you by the nose instead of
shakin’ you by the hand, an’ me may never see you more.”</p>

<p>The poor fellow’s voice became unsteady with emotion,
although the smile at his own humour was upon his face at the
time.</p>

<p>“As I came in with a bloody nose,” he proceeded, giving
that of Hewson a fresh pull, “you know you must go out with
one. An’ now God’s blessin’ be with you! Think of one who
loved you as none else did.”</p>

<p>The next morning there was uproar, tumult, and confusion
in the house of the old loyalist magistrate, when it was discovered
that his daughter and the butler were not forthcoming.
But when, on examining the observatory, it was ascertained
that Finnegan was safe and Hewson gone, no language can
describe the rage and fury of Moore, Irwin, and the military
in general. Our readers may anticipate what occurred. The
noble fellow was brought to the drum-head, tried, and sentenced
to be shot where he stood: but ere the sentence was
put in execution, Moore addressed him. “Now, Finnegan,”
said he, “I will get you off, if you tell us where Hewson and
my daughter are. I pledge my honour publicly that I’ll save
your life, and get you a free pardon, if you enable us to trace
and recover them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where they are,” he replied, “but even if I
did, I would not betray them.”</p>

<p>“Think of what has been said to you,” added Irwin. “I
give you my pledge also to the same effect.”</p>

<p>“Mr Irwin,” he replied, “I have but one word to say.
When I did what I did, I knew very well that my life would
go for his; an’ I know that if he had thought so, he would be
standin’ now in my place. Put your sentence in execution;
I’m prepared.”</p>

<p>“Take five minutes,” said Moore. “Give him up and live.”</p>

<p>“Mr Moore,” said he, with a decision and energy which
startled them, “<span class="smcap">I am his Foster-Brother!</span>”</p>

<p>This was felt to be sufficient; he stood at the appointed
place, calm and unshrinking, and at the first discharge fell instantaneously
dead.</p>

<p>Thus passed a spirit worthy of a place in a brighter page
than that of our humble miscellany, and which, if the writer
of this lives, will be more adequately recorded.</p>

<p>Hewson, finding that the insurgent cause was becoming hopeless,
escaped, after two or three other unsuccessful engagements,
to America, instigated by the solicitations of his young
wife. Old Moore died in a few years afterwards, but he survived
his resentment, for he succeeded in reconciling the then
government to his son-in-law, who returned to Ireland; and
it was found by his will, much to the mortification of many of
his relatives, that he had left the bulk of his property to Mrs
Hewson, who had always been his favourite child, and whose
attachment to Hewson he had himself originally encouraged.</p>

<p>There are two records more connected with this transaction,
with which we shall close. In a northern newspaper,
dated some fifteen years afterwards, there occurs the following
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Affair of Honour&mdash;Fatal Duel.</span>&mdash;Yesterday morning,
at the early hour of five o’clock, a duel was fought between
A. Irwin, Esq. and J. Hewson, Esq. of Mooredale, the
former of whom, we regret to say, fell by the second fire.
We hope the words attributed to one of the parties are not
correctly reported. The blood of Frank Finnegan is now
avenged.”</p>

<p>The other record is to be found in the churchyard of &mdash;&mdash;,
where there is a handsome monument erected, with the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sacred to the memory of Francis Finnegan, whose death
presented an instance of the noblest virtue of which human
nature is capable, that of laying down his life for his friend.
This monument is erected to his memory by James Hewson,
his friend and foster-brother, for whom he died.”</p>

<p>Our College Library is a creditable establishment&mdash;a goodly
structure to look at, both inside and out&mdash;and has a choice
and ample collection of books of all sizes and in all languages.
Gentle reader, have you ever felt the book passion? Know
you what it is? If not, belike you might walk down our
noble library’s length, and survey the books and busts, and
stalls and gallery at each side, and the beautiful antique manuscripts
in glass cases at the end just before you enter the
Fagel Library, and be no more impressed&mdash;you will excuse
us&mdash;no more than a grave-digger in knocking about an old
coffin or a skull, yea, though the skull should once have belonged
to poor Yorick, the king’s jester! Ah, sir, the passion
is a tender one, if you knew but all&mdash;full of lack-a-daisical
and melancholy, yet pleasing fancies. There are people
smitten by the mere outside of a book&mdash;by the fineness of the
paper, the breadth of the margin, or the beauty of the letter-press;
but they know nothing of the true affection. Give
them an annual, or an album, or any other bit of gilt gingerbread,
and they will have all they require to their hearts’
content. Let them make sonnets to their mistress’s eyebrow;
there is no soul in them; they are mere dandies; they
have nothing congenial with the true passion. To be a proper
lover of books a man must have been a great reader of
them; and the more his reading, the stronger will be his love
for them. They then present themselves to him with their
train of associations, and as his eye passes along the shelves,
he recognises each volume as an old acquaintance: some he
shakes hands with cordially; with some he exchanges a few
words; others he just nods to, and to some perhaps he may
give the cut direct; but he knows them all in some way or
other. As the review of a fine army to an old general, so is
a fine library to a true student. He loves to see his levy <i lang="fr">en
masse</i>, and in detail. The sight of them cheers his spirits,
elevates his mind, and&mdash;mark this, gentle reader&mdash;gives him
the idea of power. There lies a great secret, which in these
costermonger days we deserve great credit for communicating
to the world free-gratis for nothing.</p>

<p>Knowledge is power&mdash;that’s our major; there one stands
in the midst of a noble army of books&mdash;that’s our minor, or
lieutenant; then a man feels strong, and vastly well pleased
with himself&mdash;and that is our fife and drum, or conclusion,
by every law of drill or logic.</p>

<p>In our juvenile days, before we were A-B-C’d, and therefore
before we enjoyed the privilege of free ingress and egress at the
superb Old Trinity, we used to pass whole days of rumination
in the quiet pastures of Marsh’s. This library, situate
in an antique building to one side of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral,
is graciously open to the public in general, and to all
under-graduates of the University in particular, and wears a
secluded, cloistered, antiquated air about it, that invites to
contemplation. You are there on classic ground. The
genius of Swift seems to hover o’er you. You fancy yourself
with an age that has passed away, and among spirits that
have long since winged their flight from earth. Many a
summer’s day have we mused and read, and read and mused,
in its delightful solitude, without any other interruption save
the cackling of hens and crowing of cocks in some of the
neighbouring yards, the playing or screaming of children in
Kevin-street or Mitre-alley, the scolding of women in some
of the adjoining houses, or a few words of conversational
politeness interchanged between us and the Rev. Mr Cradoe,
the librarian, chiefly on the news of the morning.</p>

<p>But as a book-store, Marsh’s is not to be compared with
the College Library. Formerly this splendid repository was
open only four hours in the day for public use, from eight till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
ten in the morning, and from eleven till one; but a more
liberal access to its treasures has been conceded of late; the
entire is now free from nine in the morning till four in the
afternoon, without interruption. This is a great acquisition
to the privileged, and has been attended by a vast increase of
readers and visitors; but there is still room for amendment
in particulars of no small importance to general convenience.
We are happy to say, however, that to some of these the attention
of the enlightened heads of the University has been
directed, and that great improvements in the economy of the
institution may at no distant day be expected. In the first
place, the books are exceedingly ill arranged, and there is no
printed catalogue of them, so that the visitor finds great difficulty
in laying his hand upon those he may be in quest of; in
addition to which it may be stated, that there is no attendant
librarian, or other official whose duty it is to give information,
or procure the work which the visitor may require.
They order this matter better in France; but whatever may
be intended as to such functionaries, we have learned with
much satisfaction that a new catalogue is now in course of
preparation, and that it is to be a printed one. The preparing
of so great a work for the press must necessarily occupy
a good deal of time. It has been, we understand, now about
two years in hands, and will be completed, it is expected, in
about two more. There are six writing-clerks constantly
employed in preparing slips for the printer, under competent
direction. A greatly improved classification will be
effected, and the printed volumes, when perfected, will be
offered for sale. Incidental to the execution of this great
work, there will be a new and improved arrangement of the
books on the shelves to correspond with that in the catalogues;
and when both these important matters are effected,
it is obvious that the difficulties which are now experienced
in the pursuit of knowledge within this venerable gallery, will
be in a great degree removed.</p>

<p>There is another point on which complaints are sometimes
made, namely, the excessive cold of the building in winter.
It was originally intended that no fires should be lit in it, as
a security to its valuable but highly combustible contents
against accident through that medium; but in this provision, it
is plain, the preservative principle was much more attended to
than the utilitarian, and is carried, as we conceive at the present
day, to an unreasonable length. But, at all events, modern
ingenuity can meet the difficulty; for the air may be heated
by means of tubes, without the immediate presence of combustion;
wherefore we are led to expect that the same
liberal and enlightened spirit which has suggested and directed
the realization of other improvements, will direct and
realize this also in due time.</p>

<p>By the bye, the origin of this great establishment is curious.
On the defeat of the Spaniards by the English at the battle
of Kinsale in 1603, we are told that the triumphant soldiery
determined to commemorate their victory by some permanent
monument, and that they collected among themselves
the sum of £1800, which they resolved should be laid out in
the purchase of books for a library, to be founded in the then
infant establishment of Trinity College.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This sum was
handed to the celebrated Ussher, and by him judiciously expended,
conformably to the wishes of the generous conquerors
at Kinsale. And here we pause to pay our most profound
respects to the memory of these literary warriors. Who
would have expected that the most scientific, and studious,
and intellectual men of <em>our</em> age, would owe the most splendid
temple dedicated to their use, which the country can boast, to
the bounty of a victorious soldiery in the beginning of the seventeenth
century? There was a spirit of chivalry in this
transaction which we cannot sufficiently admire; and though
we live in an age in which we pique ourselves excessively on
the march of intellect, we doubt that any testimonial more
solid and convincing is producible by us to show that our
organ of veneration in this respect is at all more highly developed
than that of men who went before us in the days of
Queen Elizabeth. The bequest at all events does honour
to the profession of arms, and we are sure would be duly appreciated
by a grateful posterity, as a memorial of their mind
and achievements, if it were only more generally known.</p>

<p>So began our splendid University Library. In process of
time its collection of volumes was increased by many valuable
donations, till at length their growing number demanding a
corresponding increase of room, the present edifice was erected
for their reception. It is built of hewn stone, with a rich Corinthian
entablature, crowned with a balustrade, reminding
us in its appearance of the gallery of the Louvre at Paris, and
was completed in 1732. The room is certainly the finest in
the empire appropriated to such a purpose. It is 210 feet
long, 41 feet broad, and 40 feet high, and is very elegantly
and suitably fitted up. At its farther end, in the eastern pavilion,
is a fine apartment 52 feet long, 26 wide, and 22 high,
containing the Fagel library, purchased at an expence of
£8000, and comprising upwards of 17,000 volumes. This
library was the property of Mr Fagel, Pensionary of Holland,
who had it removed to London on the French invasion of Holland
in 1794; the purchase money was a grant to the College
from the Governors of Sir Erasmus Smith’s schools. The
total number of volumes now in the entire building, including
the Fagel library, and 1419 volumes of manuscripts, is 89,455.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The manuscripts are in Greek, Latin, English, Irish, Hebrew,
Arabic, Persian, and other languages. Many of them relate
to Irish history and antiquities, particularly to the troubles of
1641, all the depositions relating to which are here; as also the
particulars of the settlement of Ireland and plantation of it by
James I. There are many Latin manuscripts of the sacred
scriptures, particularly of the New Testament, of various ages
and remote antiquity. Several are in the Irish character but
Latin language. There is also the Greek manuscript of the
New Testament that belonged to Montfortius, and is the only
one extant that reads the once contested verse, 1 Ep. John,
ch. 5, v. 7. There are old translations of the Bible by Wickliffe,
Pervie, Ambrose, Ussher, &amp;c. There is no fund for the augmentation
of the library except what the Board may please to
allot for the purpose; but it receives a great annual increase
by being entitled to one copy of every work entered at Stationers’
Hall.</p>

<p>Our library and the Bodleian at Oxford are exactly of
the same age; and it is another curious fact, that while Ussher
was laying out the soldiers’ money in London to the best
advantage, he met there Sir T. Bodley engaged in a similar
business for his establishment at Oxford. If there were auction
rooms in those days, we have no doubt the two gentlemen
were acceptable visitors, heartily welcome to the auctioneers,
and that they seldom let a good thing go without a smart
competition.</p>

<p>With regard to Marsh’s Library, we may mention that it was
founded in 1707 by Doctor Narcissus Marsh, then Archbishop
of Dublin, and that the building is erected on part of the
ground attached to what was formerly the archbishop’s palace.
The books were originally the collection of the celebrated
Bishop Stillingfleet, and were purchased by Doctor Marsh for
the public use. Once upon a time each book was fastened
by a chain to an iron rod which ran along the shelves, so that
all who partook of the bounty of the good archbishop might
read and satisfy their souls without any danger of violating
the eighth commandment; but this stringent system is now
abolished: the chains are broken; the prisoners are free;
the books are emancipated! The change may be considered
as a compliment to the honesty of modern times; and all we
say is, we wish they may deserve it. Much as we admire
and commend these great public institutions, however, it is
not to be denied that their real amount of utility is limited
enough&mdash;limited at least when one compares the end with the
means. Many thousand volumes must lie on their shelves
from year to year, without ever being opened; there must be
many that are fit only for burning, and that just occupy good
room to the exclusion of their betters; and as to the very
best books, how limited must the access to them necessarily
be in a great public room! Their use consists chiefly in their
being available for consultation&mdash;a most important purpose,
no doubt, but yet one the accomplishment of which still leaves
a vast hiatus in our reading hours to be filled up by other
means. Now, every individual, we humbly think, should have
a library of his own, if it were ever so small. No man ever
made a good gardener that had not a small garden, his own property,
to begin with; and it is something the same with a good
reader. The careful, and leisurely, and repeated study of a
few good books, does one more real good than a cursory and
indigestive perusal of a vast number. This is well known;
and, therefore, without detracting from the just value of public
libraries, we would wish that a taste for book-collecting, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
well as book-reading, were widely diffused among us. Take
our word for it, there is no better company than good books;
you may choose from among them companions for all hours,
and for all moods of the mind. Ask them questions, and
they will be sure at all times to give you at least a civil answer.
They are finger-posts to the travelling man, and travel
through all regions to him who never moves from the chimney
corner. They are implements of trade to the professional
man, and a profession itself to him that has none. They are
music to the melancholy, and as a dance to the merry; as salt
are they to the solid, and to the solid as salt. They are as a
new world to him that has exhausted the old, for “of making
many books,” as the preacher saith, “there is no end.” But
we must come to an end ourselves. We would, in short, advocate
the claims of literature in general, and its high title
to consideration, as it commends itself to all men in common;
and we plead guilty to the ambition of adding to the numerous
honourable characteristics of our countrymen, that of
being in an eminent degree a reading people. Irishmen
ought to remember that their country was famous in ancient
days for its learning, and cherish an honest ambition in modern
times to retrieve its character. As one means of forwarding
this object, we would seek to diffuse among them a reading
habit, and give our best encouragement to whatever instrumentalities
might tend to increase libraries, and make reading
easy to all classes. Cheap literature is a luxury of sterling
value; but until people have acquired a taste for it, they will
hold it cheap enough. Never do we pass a book-shop, or
an humble bookseller’s stall, without a feeling of reverence
for the profession. There, say we, is a dispensary of ideal
aliment indispensable to our mental existence, and, if properly
used, yielding nothing but health, prosperity, and enjoyment
to the soul. If our countrymen read, they will become informed&mdash;learned;
and if they read good books, they must
not only become informed and learned, but wise. The vivacity
of their conversation will then be enriched with all the
streams both of useful and entertaining knowledge. Reading
will be a delightful resource to the working man, and no
bad employment at least to the idle. Poverty will have its
compensations. There will be another distinction set up in
society besides that of having, or not having, mere worldly
professions. The dignity of mind will be asserted. Mind
with its congenial influences must act upon manners; and if, as
the inscription upon the old gate at Oxford beareth record,
“manours maketh ye man,” our country will be once more
exalted among the nations.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE THUGS.</h2>

<p>The Thugs were known in the time of the Emperor Akbar
of Delhi, by whom many were executed. They were first
known to the British government in 1812, and then many
were hanged in Bundelkund. Again, in 1817, they attracted
notice by their horrible acts, and twelve villages in Bundelkund,
which were peopled almost entirely by them, were taken
by a force sent against them. They were then dispersed, but
assembled in various parts in Sindhia’s and the Nagpoor
country, also in Holkar’s dominions. From 1817 till 1831
they were not molested, and, in consequence, increased
greatly in the latter year. Measures were taken to suppress
them, which have been attended with great success. One
hundred and eleven were executed at Jubbulpoor, and upwards
of four hundred transported for life to the eastern settlement
of Pinang.</p>

<p>The Thugs form a perfectly distinct class of persons, who
subsist almost entirely upon the produce of the murders they
are in the habit of committing. They appear to have derived
their denomination from the practice usually adopted by them
of decoying the persons they fix upon to destroy, to join their
party; and then, taking advantage of the confidence they endeavour
to inspire, to strangle their unsuspecting victims.
There are several peculiarities in the habits of the Thugs,
in their mode of causing death, and in the precautions they
adopt for the prevention of discovery, that distinguish them
from every other class of delinquents; and it may be considered
a general rule whereby to judge of them, that they affect
to disclaim the practice of petty theft, housebreaking, and
indeed every species of stealing that has not been preceded
by the perpetration of murder.</p>

<p>The Thugs adopt no other method of killing but strangulation,
and the implement made use of for this purpose is a
handkerchief, or any other convenient strip of cloth. The
manner in which the deed is done will be described hereafter.
They never attempt to rob a traveller until they have in the
first instance deprived him of life; after the commission of a
murder, they invariably bury the body immediately, if time
and opportunity serve, or otherwise conceal it; and never
leave a corpse uninterred in the highway, unless they happen
to be disturbed.</p>

<p>To trace the origin of this practice would now be a matter
of some difficulty, for if the assertions of the Thugs themselves
are entitled to any credit, it has been in vogue from
time immemorial; and they pretend that its institution is
coeval with the creation of the world. Like most other inhuman
practices, the traditions regarding it are mixed up with
tales of Hindoo superstition; and the Thugs would wish to
make it appear, that, in immolating the numberless victims
that yearly fall by their hands, they are only obeying the injunctions
of the deity of their worship, to whom they say they
are offering an acceptable sacrifice.</p>

<p>A very considerable number of the Thugs are Mussulmans.
No judgment of the birth or caste of a Thug can, however,
be formed from his name; for it not unfrequently happens
that a Hindoo Thug has a Mussulman name with a Hindoo
<i lang="la">alias</i> attached, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i> with respect to the Thugs who
are by birth Mahommedans. In almost every instance the
Thugs have more than one appellation by which they are
known. They usually move in large parties, often amounting
to one hundred or two hundred persons, and resort to all sort
of subterfuges for the purpose of concealing their real profession.
If they are travelling southward, they represent
themselves to be either proceeding in quest of service, or on
their way to rejoin the regiments they belong to in this part of
the country. When, on the contrary, their route lies towards
the north, they represent themselves to be sepoys from corps
of the Bombay or Nizam’s army, who are going on leave to
Hindustan. The gangs do not always consist of persons who
are Thugs by birth. It is customary for them to entice, by
the promise of monthly pay or the hopes of amassing money
that are held out, many persons who are ignorant of the
deeds of death that are to be perpetrated for the attainment
of these objects, until made aware of the reality by seeing the
victims of their cupidity fall under the hands of the stranglers;
and the Thugs declare that novices have occasionally been so
horrified at the sight as to have effected their immediate escape.</p>

<p>Many of the most notorious Thugs are the adopted children
of others of the same class. They make it a rule, when
a murder is committed, never to spare the life of any one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
either male or female, who is old enough to remember and relate
the particulars of the deed. But in the event of their
meeting with children of such a tender age as to make it impossible
they should be enabled to relate the fact, they generally
spare their lives, and, adopting them, bring them up to
the trade of Thugs. These men of course eventually become
acquainted with the fact of the murder of their fathers and
mothers by the very persons with whom they have dwelt
since their childhood, but are still not deterred from following
the same dreadful trade. It might be supposed that a class
of persons whose hearts must be effectually hardened against
all the better feelings of humanity, would encounter few
scruples of conscience in the commission of the horrid deeds
whereby they subsist; but, in point of fact, they are as much
the slaves of superstition, and as much directed by the observance
of omens in the commission of murder, as the most inoffensive
of the natives of India are in the ordinary affairs of
their lives.</p>

<p>In the event of an expedition proving more than ordinarily
successful, a pilgrimage is usually made to Bhowanee, and a
portion of the spoil taken by the gang is set aside for the purpose
of being sent to the pagoda at Binda Chul, near Mirzapoor,
as an offering to the goddess Kalee. Propitiatory offerings
are also made, and various ceremonies performed, should
the Thugs have failed in obtaining any plunder for a length
of time.</p>

<p>In every gang of Thugs are to be found one or more officers,
who appear to hold that rank not by the choice of their followers,
but in consequence of their wealth and influence in
their respective villages, and having assembled their immediate
followers in the vicinity of their homes. The profits of an officer
are of course greater than those of his followers; he receives
six and a half or seven per cent. on all silver coin and
other property, and then shares in the remainder in common
with the other Thugs of the party. When gold is obtained
in coin or in mass, the tenth part is taken by the officer, previous
to dividing it; and he has a tithe of all pearls, shawls,
gold embroidered cloths, brass and copper pots, horses, &amp;c.
Next to the officer, the most important person is the <em>bhuttoat</em>,
or strangler, who carries the handkerchief with which the
Thugs usually murder their victims. This implement is
merely a piece of fine strong cotton cloth, about a yard long;
at one end a knot is tied, and the cloth is slightly twisted, and
kept ready for use in front of the waistcoat of the person carrying
it. There is no doubt but that all Thugs are expert in
the use of the handkerchief; but if they are to be believed,
only particular persons are called upon or permitted to perform
this office. When a large gang is collected, the most
able-bodied and alert of their number are fixed upon as stranglers,
and they are made the bearers of the handkerchief only
after the performance of various and often expensive ceremonies,
and only on the observance of a favourable omen. The
junior Thugs make a merit of attending upon the older and
more experienced Thugs, shampooing their bodies, and performing
the most menial offices. They gradually become initiated
into all the mysteries of the art, and if they prove to be
powerful men, these promising disciples are made stranglers.
When a murder is to be committed, the strangler usually follows
the particular person whom he has been nominated by
the jemadar to strangle; and on the preconcerted signal
being given, the handkerchief is seized with the knot in the
<em>left hand</em>, the right hand being about nine inches farther up,
in which manner it is thrown over the head of the person to
be strangled from behind; the two hands are crossed as the
victim falls; and such is the certainty with which the deed is
done, as the Thugs frequently declare, that before the body
falls to the ground, the eyes start out of the head, and life becomes
extinct. Should the person to be strangled prove a
powerful man, or the strangler inexpert, another Thug lays
hold of the end of the handkerchief, and the work is completed.
The perfection of the act is said to be, when several
persons are simultaneously murdered without any of them
having time to utter a cry, or to be aware of the fate of their
comrades.</p>

<p>Favourable opportunities are given for stranglers to make
their first essay in the art of strangling. When a single traveller
is met with, a novice is instructed to make a trial of his
skill; the party sets off during the night, and stops while it
is still dark to drink water or to smoke. While seated for
the purpose, the jemadar inquires what time of the night it
may be, and the Thugs look up at the stars to ascertain. This
being the preconcerted signal, the strangler is immediately on
the alert, and the unsuspecting traveller, on looking up at the
heavens in common with the rest of the party, offers his neck
to the ready handkerchief, and becomes an easy prey to his
murderer. The strangler receives half a rupee extra for every
murder that is committed, and if the plunder is great, some
article of value is assigned to him over and above his share.</p>

<p>One of the most necessary persons to a gang of Thugs is
he who goes by the name of Tillaee, or spy. The Thugs do
not always depend upon chance for obtaining plunder, or roam
about in the expectation of meeting travellers, but frequently
take up their quarters in or near a large town, or some great
thoroughfare, from whence they make expeditions, according
to the information obtained by the spies. These men are
chosen from among the most smooth-spoken and intelligent of
their number, and their chief duty is to gain information. For
this purpose they are decked out in the garb of respectable
persons, whose appearance and manners they must have the
art of assuming. They frequent the bazaars of the town near
which their associates are encamped, and endeavour to pick
up intelligence of the intended dispatch or expected arrival of
goods or treasure, of which information is forthwith given to
the gang, who send out a party to intercept them. Inquiry
is also made for any party of travellers who may have arrived,
and who put up in the inns, or elsewhere. Every art
is brought into practice to scrape an acquaintance with these
people. They are given to understand that the spy is travelling
the same road. An opportunity is taken to throw out
hints regarding the unsafeness of the roads, and the frequency
of murders and robberies; an acquaintance with some of the
friends or relatives of the travellers is feigned, and an invitation
from them to partake of the repast that has been prepared
where the spy has put up&mdash;the conveniences of which, and the
superiority of the water, are abundantly praised. The result
is, that the travellers are inveigled into joining the gang of
Thugs, and they are feasted and treated with every politeness
and consideration by the very wretches who are at the time
plotting their murder, and calculating the share they shall acquire
in the division of their property.</p>

<p>Instances sometimes occur where a party of Thugs find
their victims too numerous for them while they remain in a
body, and they are seldom at a loss for expedients to create
dissensions, and a consequent division among them. If all
their arts of intrigue and cajolery fail in producing the desired
effect, an occasion is taken advantage of to ply the travellers
with intoxicating liquors; a quarrel is got up, and from
words they proceed to blows, which end in the dissension of
the company, who, proceeding by different roads, fall an easier
prey to their remorseless destroyers. Having enticed the travellers
into the snare they have laid for them, the next object
is to choose a convenient spot for their murder. This, in
their technical language, is called a <em>bhil</em>, and is usually fixed
upon at some distance from a village on the banks of a small
stream, where the trees and underwood afford a shelter from
the view of occasional passengers. The Thug who is sent on
this duty is called a <em>bhilla</em>; and having fixed on the place, he
either returns to the encampment of his party, or meets them
on the way to report the result of his inquiry. If the bhilla
returns to the camp with his report, the grave-diggers are
sent out with him to prepare a grave for the interment of the
persons it is intended to murder. Arrangements are previously
made, so that the party in company with the travellers shall
not arrive at the bhil too soon. At the particular spot agreed
on, the bhilla meets the party. The jemadar calls out to him,
“Have you cleared out the hole?” The bhilla replies, “Yes,”
on which the concerted signal is given that serves as the death-warrant
of the unsuspecting travellers, who are forthwith
strangled.</p>

<p>The division of plunder, as may be supposed, often leads
to the most violent disputes, which it is astonishing do not
end in bloodshed. But it might almost be supposed the Thugs
have a prejudice against spilling blood; for, when pursued,
they refrain from making use of the weapons they usually
bear, even in defence of their own persons. The most wanton
prodigality occurs when plunder is divided; and occasionally
the most valuable shawls and brocades are torn into small
strips, and distributed amongst the gang, should any difference
of opinion arise as to their appropriation. The Thugs
say this is also done that every person may run the same
risk, for such an article could not be shared among them until
converted into money, and some danger is attendant upon the
transaction. They appear invariably to destroy all bills of
exchange that fall into their hands, as well as many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
articles that are likely to lead to detection. Ready money
is what they chiefly look for; and when they have a choice of
victims, the possessors of gold and silver would certainly be
fixed upon in preference to others.</p>

<p>To facilitate their plan of operations, the Thugs have established
a regular system of intelligence and communication
throughout the countries they have been in the practice of
frequenting, and they become acquainted, with astonishing
celerity, with proceedings of their comrades in all directions.
They omit no opportunity of making inquiries regarding the
progress of other gangs, and are equally particular in supplying
the requisite information of their own movements. For
this purpose they have connected themselves with several
persons of note residing in the Nizam’s dominions, who follow
the profession of Thugs in conjunction with their agricultural
pursuits.</p>

<p>Such is the extent to which this dreadful system has been
carried, that no idea can be formed of the expenditure of human
life to which it has given occasion, or the immensity of
the wealth that has been acquired by its adoption. When it
is taken into consideration that many of the Thugs confess to
their having, for the last twenty-five or thirty years, annually
made a tour with parties of more than a hundred men, and
with no other object than that of murder and rapine; that
they boast of having successively put their tens and twenties
to death daily; and that they say an enumeration of all the
lives they have personally assisted to destroy would swell the
catalogue to hundreds, and, as some declare, to thousands&mdash;some
conception of the horrid reality may be formed; of the
amount of the property that they have yearly made away
with, it must be impossible to form any calculation; for, independent
of the thousands in ready money, jewels and bullion,
the loads of valuable cloths, and every description of merchandise,
that continually fall into their hands, the bills of
exchange that they invariably destroy must amount to a considerable
sum.</p>

<p>The impunity with which the Thugs have heretofore carried
on their merciless proceedings, the facility they have possessed
of recruiting their numbers&mdash;which are restricted to
no particular caste or sect&mdash;the security they have had of
escaping detection, and the ease with which they have usually
purchased their release when seized by the officers of the
weak native governments in whose dominions they have
usually committed their greatest depredations, have altogether
so tended to confirm the system, and to disseminate it
to the fearful extent to which it has now attained, that the
life of no single traveller on any of the roads in the country
has been safe, and but a slight chance has been afforded to
large parties of escaping the fangs of the blood-thirsty
demons who have frequented them.&mdash;<cite>Abridged from the New
Monthly Magazine.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Love and Poetry.</span>&mdash;“You know,” says Burns, “our country
custom of coupling a man and woman together as partners in
the labours of harvest. In my fifteenth autumn my partner
was a bewitching creature, a year younger than myself. My
scarcity of English denies me the power of doing her justice
in that language; she was a <em>bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass</em>. In
short, she altogether, unwittingly to herself, initiated me in
that delicious passion, which, in spite of acid disappointment,
gin-horse prudence, and book-worm philosophy, I hold to be
the first of human joys, our sweetest blessing here below.
How she caught the contagion I cannot tell; you medical
people talk much of infection from breathing the same air, the
touch, &amp;c., but I never expressly said I loved her. Indeed, I did
not know myself why I liked so much to loiter behind with her,
when returning in the evening from our labours; why the
tones of her voice made my heart-strings thrill like an Æolian
harp; and particularly why my pulse beat such a furious ratan
when I looked and fingered over her little hand, to pick out
the cruel nettle-stings and thistles. Among her other love-inspiring
qualities she sang sweetly; and it was her favourite
reel to which I attempted giving an embodied vehicle in rhyme.
I was not so presumptuous as to imagine that I could make verses
like printed ones, composed by men who had Greek and Latin;
but my girl sang a song which was said to be composed by a
small country laird’s son, on one of his father’s maids with
whom he was in love; and I saw no reason why I might not
rhyme as well as he; for, excepting that he could smear sheep,
and cast peats, his father living on the moorlands, he had no
more scholarcraft than myself. Thus with me began Love
and Poetry.”&mdash;<cite>Burns in a Letter to Dr Moore, 1787.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Phenomena of Sound.</span>&mdash;In the Arctic regions persons can
converse at more than a mile distant when the thermometer
is below zero. In air, sound travels from 1130 to 1142 feet
per second. In water, sound passes at the rate of 4708 feet
per second. Sound travels in air, about 900 feet for every
pulsation of a healthy person at 75 in a minute. A bell
sounded under water may be heard under water at 1200 feet
distant. Sounds are distinct at twice the distance on water
that they are on land. In a balloon, the barking of dogs on
the ground may be heard at an elevation of three or four
miles. On Table Mountain, a mile above Cape Town, every
noise in it, and even words, may be heard distinctly. The
fire of the English on landing in Egypt was distinctly heard
130 miles on the sea. Dr Jameson says, in calm weather he
heard every word of a sermon at the distance of two miles!
Water is a better conductor of sound than air. Wood is
also a powerful conductor of sound, and so is flannel or riband.
Sound affects particles of dust in a sunbeam, cobwebs,
and water in musical glasses; it shakes small pieces of
paper off a string in concord. Deaf persons may converse
through deal rods held between the teeth, or held to the
throat or breast. Echoes are formed by elliptical surfaces
combined with surrounding surfaces, or by such of them as fall
into the respective distances of the surface of an ellipse, and
are, therefore, directed to the other focus of the ellipse; for
all the distances from both foci to such surface are equal, and
hence there is a concentration of sounds at those points direct
from one focus, and reflected back again from the other
focus. An echo returns a monosyllable at 70 feet distance,
and another syllable at every 40 feet additional. The echo
of artillery is encreased or created by a cloud or clouds.
Miners distinguish the substance bored by the sound; and
Physicians distinguish the action of the heart or lungs by a
listening tube. Gamblers can distinguish, in tossing money,
which side is undermost, though covered by the hand.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">General Run of Faculties.</span>&mdash;Society is a more level
surface than we imagine. Wise men or absolute fools are
hard to be met with, as there are few giants or dwarfs. The
heaviest charge we can bring against the general texture of
society is, that it is common-place; and many of those who
are singular had better be common-place. Our fancied superiority
to others is in some one thing, which we think most
of, because we excel in it, or have paid most attention to it;
whilst we overlook their superiority to us in something else,
which they set equal and exclusive store by. This is fortunate
for all parties. I never felt myself superior to any one
who did not go out of his way to affect qualities which he had
not. In his own individual character and line of pursuit every
one has knowledge, experience, and skill; and who shall say
which pursuit requires most, thereby proving his own narrowness
and incompetence to decide? Particular talent or genius
does not imply general capacity. Those who are more versatile
are seldom great in any one department; and the stupidest
people can generally do something. The highest pre-eminence
in any one study commonly arises from the concentration
of the attention and faculties on that one study. He
who expects from a great name in politics, in philosophy, in
art, equal greatness in other things, is little versed in human
nature. Our strength lies in our weakness. The learned in
books are ignorant of the world. He who is ignorant of books
is often well acquainted with other things; for life is of the
same length in the learned and the unlearned; the mind cannot
be idle; if it is not taken up with one thing it attends to
another through choice or necessity: and the degree of previous
capacity in one class or another is a mere lottery.&mdash;<cite>Hazlitt’s
Characteristics.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Truth.</span>&mdash;The confusion and undesigned inaccuracy so
often to be observed in conversation, especially in that of uneducated
persons, proves that truth needs to be cultivated as
a talent, as well as recommended as a virtue.&mdash;<cite>Mrs Fry.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4">Knowledge is an excellent drug, but no drug has virtue
enough to preserve itself from corruption and decay, if the
vessel be tainted and impure wherein it is put to keep.&mdash;<cite>Montaigne’s

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
